# TartanPaints

Webpage features for Tartan Paints

This project is done by Eril Levana and Mostafa Tamim Mahmud as a Design Project at RMIT University.

The clients are Tartan Paints, a new paint company based in melbourne. Website Link: www.tartanpaints.com.au

The tasks for the design project is to add two Tools to the website of Tartan Paints:

1. Color Picker tool (swatch of colors for users to pick from)
2. Color Visualizer tool (Demo of paint color on a wall/interior picture)

Case: The website that Tartan Paints are currently using is created by a Content Management System called Udo - which is a custom CMS built by a company here in melbourne. Due to lack of documentation on the cms to integrate custom codes, we have decided to currently deploy the features in an external webpage.

User Journey to be affected: While choosing a paint - users will select the type and amount of paint they want to buy and when they want to choose a color, a separate window will open, where both the tools created by us will be implemented.
